Currently still in development

Express/Node server connecting with dc.js on the front end.
Uses BinaryServer (binaryjs) to stream large JSON file (too big for github!!) as a binary file to the client


TODO (GRAPHICS-WISE):

1. Subscriber/Customer pie chart (one time user or subscriber), filtered by #1 and subsequent
2. Male/female pie chart (data only available for Subscribers, filtered by #1 and subsequent )
3. Data table for start stop, listing by most frequent (filtered by #1 and subsequent)
4. Data table for end stop, listing by most frequent (filtered by #2 and subsequent)

Potentially replace #3 and #4 with map for most frequent routes, but only as final step after previous stuff working.
